UWP Async MVVM Sample
=======================

This sample demonstrates how to use common Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) patterns in UWP asynchronously.

It is a complete working sample derived from the following series of articles by Stephen Cleary, originally published on MSDN Magazine for WPF:

 - [Async/Await - Best Practices in Asynchronous Programming](https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/jj991977)
 - [Async Programming : Patterns for Asynchronous MVVM Applications: Data Binding](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn605875.aspx)
 - [Async Programming : Patterns for Asynchronous MVVM Applications: Commands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn630647.aspx)

They have been rewritten for UWP and provided here as a reference.

Requirements
------------
Requires VS 2017 and Windows 10 version 15063 or above.
